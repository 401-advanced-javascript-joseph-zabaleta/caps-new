## Overview
A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see whatâ€™s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).


## Development Process
Current Phase: Phase 2

#### Phase 1: Event Driven Applications
- Using built-in Node.js events to simulate realtime package delivery changes

#### Phase 2: Socket.io
- Replace Node Event Pool with `socket.io`
- Cleaner event handling
- Allows web connectivity

#### Phase 3: Queues
- Adding in the delivery queue logic
- Storage of all inbound events
- Receipt confirmation
- Catchup Mode

## Installation
- Clone down a copy of the repository.
- There are three parts to this application now.
- `Server`
    - Inside the `lib/server/` run `npm install`
    - Followed by `npm start`
    - This will start the hub for all subscribers
- `Vendor`
    - Inside the `lib/app/vendor/` run `npm install`
    - Followed by `npm start`
    - This will start the vendor app which will start producting orders for pickup
- `Driver`
    - Inside the `lib/app/driver/` run `npm install`
    - Followed by `npm start`
    - This will start the driver app which will pickup and deliver orders.

NOTE: Each part must be running in its own terminal.

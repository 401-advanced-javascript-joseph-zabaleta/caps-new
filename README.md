## Overview
A real-time service that allows for vendors, such as flower shops or restaurants, to alert a system of a package needing to be delivered, for drivers to instantly see what’s in their pickup queue, and then to alert the vendors as to the state of the deliveries (in transit, and then delivered).


## Development Process
Current Phase: Phase 2

#### Phase 1: Event Driven Applications
- Using built-in Node.js events to simulate realtime package delivery changes

#### Phase 2: Socket.io
- Replace Node Event Pool with `socket.io`
- Cleaner event handling
- Allows web connectivity

#### Phase 3: Queues
- Adding in the delivery queue logic
- Storage of all inbound events
- Receipt confirmation
- Catchup Mode

## Installation
- Clone down a copy of the repository.
- There are three parts to this application now.
- `Server`
    - Inside the `lib/server/` run `npm install`
    - Followed by `npm start`
    - This will start the hub for all subscribers
- `Vendor`
    - Inside the `lib/app/vendor/` run `npm install`
    - Followed by `npm start`
    - This will start the vendor app which will start producting orders for pickup
- `Driver`
    - Inside the `lib/app/driver/` run `npm install`
    - Followed by `npm start`
    - This will start the driver app which will pickup and deliver orders.

NOTE: Each part must be running in its own terminal.
